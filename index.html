                    <p class="words line2">Happy 2nd Anniversary and Valentines Love! I can't believe that it has already been 2 years. 2 years full of growth, full of care, and most especially, love. I can't tell you enough how much grateful I am to you, I may not say it, but I truly appreciate everything that you do for me. Every little thing you do to me makes me feel loved and validated like never before. I just want you to know that you have been an amazing partner and I could never ask for anything more, I love you for who you are. These past 2 years have been the happiest moments of my life, and throughout our relationship, I have never even once felt judged nor taken for granted. You have really been consistent and genuine with me all throughout. You continue to bring out the best in me, I know I haven't been the best but I will always be someone who will listen and embrace you with open arms, know that you are forever safe with me. I love you and I care for you more than words can describe, forever and always. I love you so much, Shan!<br><br>Love,<br>Jap<br><br><br></p>
